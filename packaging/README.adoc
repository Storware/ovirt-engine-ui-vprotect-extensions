= Packaging

== Introduction

This directory contains files required to package the application
for packaging systems like RPM.

== RPM

To build the RPM place the `.tar.gz` file containing distribution
of the application in this directory and then run the `build.sh`
script, specifying the version with the `tar_version` environment
variable.

For example, if the name of the file is
`ovirt-engine-ui-extensions-0.0.1.tar.gz` then use the following command:

  $ tar_version=0.0.1 build.sh

If the name of the `.tar.gz` file isn't the expected one,
you can also specify the `tar_file` environment variable:

  tar_version=0.0.1 tar_file="mytar.tar.gz" build.sh

Resulting `.rpm` file will be created in the `noarch` subdirectory.

When installed, the RPM will put the files into
`/usr/share/ovirt-engine-ui-extensions` directory.
